## Safety Concerns 🔒
Running a C++ web server comes with its own set of safety considerations. First and foremost, ensure that any user data is handled with utmost care to prevent sensitive data exposure. Given the nature of C++, be vigilant against server vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and memory leaks. It's essential to use SSL/TLS for secure data transmission, especially if transferring user data or credentials. Rate limiting should be in place to mitigate potential DDoS attacks. Additionally, be cautious with error handling; error messages should not disclose sensitive server information. Regularly update server dependencies to patch any vulnerabilities, and always validate and sanitize user input to safeguard against injection attacks. As a best practice, monitor server activities for any irregularities and have a robust backup system.
